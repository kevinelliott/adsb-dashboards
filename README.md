# ADS-B-dashboards

This repository contains several useful ADS-B Grafana dashboards.

## Content

- [aggregators_dashboard](grafana/dashboards/aggregators_dashboard.json): A dashboard that shows general statistics about several ADS-B aggregators.

## Instructions

This repository contains [docker-compose](docker-compose.yml) files that can be used to run the dashboards. You can use the following steps to do this:

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
3.  Run `docker compose up -d` inside the repository folder.
4.  Checkout the dashboards at `localhost:3000`.

## Docker-compose components

The `docker-compose` file orchestrates ~~four~~three containers, each serving a distinct purpose:

- **prometheus**: A [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) container for storing tracked data. Accessible on port `9090`.
- **json_exporter**: A Prometheus [Json Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-community/json_exporter) used for collecting API data. Accessible on port `7979`.
- ~~**adsbx_exporter**: A [custom ADSBx exporter](prometheus/exporters/adsbx_exporter/main.go) container dedicated to collecting adsbx API data. Accessible on port `19100`.~~ - No longer works due to recent [adsb-x](https://adsbexchange.com/) api changes.
- **Grafana**: A [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) container used for displaying tracked data. Accessible on port `3000`.

Furthermore, within this repository, you'll discover a [Portainer container](portainer/README.md) designed to simplify the management of other containers. Additionally, there's a dedicated [Duplicati container](duplicati/README.md) for efficiently backing up the Prometheus database. Lastly, a [Cloudflare Dockerfile](cloudflare_tunnel/README.md) facilitates the initiation of a Cloudflare tunnel, ensuring a secure way to share the ADS-B dashboard with the external world.
